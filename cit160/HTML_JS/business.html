      <h3>Business Idea</h3>
      <p>I have always wanted to create a website that sells wooden toys. I want that website to be easy to understand and provide a quick
         shopping experience. Ideally it would be one that I could create that provides ease of access for anyone especially grandparents. 
      </p>
      <h3>Pitch</h3>
      <p>Do you remember your favorite toy as a kid? Was it some extravagant toy or was it like mine; a simple wooden toy that I still have
        to this day? You shouldn't have to go to 5 different websites to find the wooden toy you want. You want an easy to understand and 
        quick shopping experience and we provide just that. We have long lasting wooden toys for kids of all ages. Our website is so simple
        and easy that grandma and grandpa can use, without giving you a call.</p>
